The following work investigates the ability to combine two separate formation control autonomies into a single formation. The two separate autonomies simulated include displacement-based and distance-based methods. Displacement-based control dictates formation shape based on set offsets from the leader agent and distance-based controlâ€™s shape by desired neighbor edge length distances. This study explores the minimal amount of information needed to combine these autonomies and methods for leader and slot selection.
